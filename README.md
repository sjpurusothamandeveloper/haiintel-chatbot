## AI Collaboration

This project was built in collaboration with AI tools:

- **ChatGPT** – helped draft the initial component structure for the chat widget,
  including the floating launcher, streaming effect, and suggestion chips.
- **Cursor / Copilot** – used inline in the editor to autocomplete repetitive UI
  patterns and refactor React hooks while I manually reviewed each change.
- **Perplexity / Web search** – used to quickly cross-check HaiIntel website
  messaging and ensure the simulated responses aligned with their public brand
  positioning (Intelligence-first, human-rooted AI).

All AI-generated code or copy was:
1. Reviewed line-by-line.
2. Manually tested in the browser.
3. Adjusted for performance, readability, and consistency with HaiIntel’s
   design language.
